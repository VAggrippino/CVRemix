              US LEC was a telephone company serving primarily corporate
              customers. Initially, my only role was maintenance of numerous
              manual processes for the management and reporting of billing data.
              There was plenty of opportunity for improvement and I took over
              the automation of processes and the conversion of (Korn) shell
              scripts to better-performing applications written in Perl. I also
              made improvements to code running within the database using
              Oracle's PL/SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I went on to improve reporting processes and I created
              new intranet reporting applications using Perl and implementing
              the <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the company started to take an interest in their customer

          ... If it said "or better", I'd still apply. I have knowledge and
          experience better than that of a Computer Science graduate and I'm
          ready to prove it.

          <p> I walk a different path... When most people would have entered
          university, I entered the US Army. When most people would have been
          <em>sowing their wild oats</em>, I was sitting in front of the
          computer learning new things... And that's before I even knew I could
          turn it into a career!
          </p>
          <p> When I decided to focus on programming, my passion became an
          obsession... Shell, Perl, C, C++, Java, PL/SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          PHP, and on and on. I wasn't organized, but I was prolific. I learned
          from countless sources... I learned from reading production code. I
          learned from the Internet. And I learned from experienced developers.

              Free Code Camp is probably the most highly respected of the free
              online educational organizations. It's curriculum is often
              compared to that of a programming bootcamp.

              Udemy can be an excellent resource for education on many topics
              from many different instructors. Unfortunately, its level of
              quality is nearly as diverse as the available topics. Udemy is
              focused more on being a medium for experts who want to earn income
              online than it is being an online educational resource... quantity
              over quality.

              SoloLearn is an effort to put programming education on mobile
              devices. It's good, but fixed-width blanks, multiple-choice, and
              drag-and-drop answers make it too easy to guess your way through
              their curriculum. It's better than playing Candy Crush! 🙂
            </p>
            <p>
              I earned all 12 of SoloLearn's certificates in less than a month
              without actually learning anything.
